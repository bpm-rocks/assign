`assign::array()`
-----------------

Send an array as a variable up to caller of a function. It is best used with some odd syntax as shown in the example, which preserves empty arrays.

* $1   - Variable name
* $2-@ - Array elements

Examples

    callFunc () {
        local myArray=(one two three)
        local "${1-}" && assign::array "$1" ${myArray[@]+"${myArray[@]}"}
    }
    callFunc dest
    echo "${dest[@]}" # writes "one two three"

Returns nothing.


`assign::byRef()`
-----------------

Assigns a value by reference.

* $1 - Destination variable name.
* $2 - Source variable name.

Copies an array or scalar to the destination. This can be much simpler than assigning arrays. See the example for further information.

Examples

    # Copy a value
    a="a string"
    assign::byRef b a
    echo "$b"  # "a string"

    # Copy an array with an unknown number of elements (even zero)
    # Replace "..." with zero or more elements.
    theArray=( ... )
    assign::byRef theArrayCopy theArray
    set | grep ^theArray
    # This shows the array was copied

    # Copies an unset value as well.
    unset unsetValue
    unsetValueCopy=something
    assign::byRef unsetValueCopy unsetValue
    set | grep ^unsetValue
    # Neither shows up.

Returns nothing.


`assign::value()`
-----------------

Send a variable up to the parent of the caller of this function.

* $1 - Variable name.
* $2 - Value to assign.

Examples

    callFunc() {
        local dest
        dest="Just an example to prove the local variable is overwritten"
        local "${1-}" && assign::value "$1" "the value"
    }

    dest="value from target scope, ignored"
    callFunc dest
    echo "$dest"  # writes "the value"

Returns nothing.
